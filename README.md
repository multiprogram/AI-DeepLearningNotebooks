# AI Deep Learning Notebooks

This repository contains programs for learning Computer Vision and (Deep) Machine Learning. All programs are written as Jupyter Notebooks and are designed to be run on Google Colab.

## Links to open the notebooks in Google Colab

Below are the links to open the notebooks in Google Colab. By clicking on the link of the notebook you want to use, it opens in Google Colab, so copy it to your Google Drive and use.

01. [Checking the performance of Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multiprogram/AI-DeepLearningNotebooks/blob/master/notebooks/00_operation_check.ipynb)

01. [Drawing graphs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multiprogram/AI-DeepLearningNotebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01_draw_graph.ipynb)

01. [Class recognition by Euclidean distance](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multiprogram/AI-DeepLearningNotebooks/blob/master/notebooks/02_clf_euc_dist.ipynb)

01. [Class recognition by Mahalanobis distance](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multiprogram/AI-DeepLearningNotebooks/blob/master/notebooks/03_clf_mahal_dist.ipynb)

01. [Supervised learning by k-nearest neighbor method](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multiprogram/AI-DeepLearningNotebooks/blob/master/notebooks/04_kNN.ipynb)

## How to run notebooks using Google Colab

To execute the repository notebook on Google Colab, replace `github.com` in the URL of the notebook you want to execute with `colab.research.google.com/github` to open it directly in Google Colab.
Then click on 'Copy to Drive' at the top of the screen, and the notebook will be copied to your Google Drive. Open the copied notebook and execute it.
